# Trajectory-Planning-for-ABB-IRB140
This project presents the trajectory planning in the operational and joint space for ABB IRB-
140 robot manipulator. The task assigned to the manipulator is spilling beer from a bottle.
Trajectory planning is based on a quintic polynomial that allows to obtain continuous velocity
and acceleration of each joint variables of manipulator, used in the joint space and in the
operational space to generate the required time laws for the primitive paths chosen. The identification
of trajectory in the operational space and inverse kinematics algorithm is mandatory
in order to obtain the joints position at each time instant.
